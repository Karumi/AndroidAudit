**Your Android app as a crime scene!**

Technical audits of iOS and Android applications have become an integral part of our daily job here at Karumi. Even though it can look easy, there are quite a few implementation details to review when performing such audit. In this document we are going to review what we believe are the most important things to check, separated by technical area. 

**Version Control System:**

Whether the engineers are using version control, which system and using what process tells us a lot of things about the software development process. 

* Do you have a properly configured *ignore file so IDE metadata files and other extraneous elements are not under version control?

* Are third party libraries versioned in the internal repository manager (Nexus, Artifactory, etc.) rather than configured as an external dependency?

* Do you use sufficiently concise and descriptive commit messages?

* Is the size of the commits reasonable?

* Are all the files in a commit related to the same issue or feature?

* Are you using branches following any branching scheme like "feature branch" or “git-flow”? 

* Are these branch names descriptive enough?

* Are you using the pull request/code review system before merging the code into master?

    * Do you have any guidelines regarding what to look for when reviewing a PR?

    * How many comments on average for every PR?

    * How many people review each PR?

    * How many +1 do you need before merging?

    * Who is responsible for closing the branch?

* Are you using release branches to prepare every release?

* How long are your staging process open?

* How many fixes do you introduce into your release candidate before to release it?

* Are you able to checkout the exact code used to build any of the published versions of your app?

* How many hotfixes have you released in the past year?

* Are you squashing the commits in a branch before merging it into the master/develop/ branch?

* Is the master/develop branch ready to be released at any time?

**Build Tools:** 

Being able to reproduce the build process on every developer machine and any other external system as continuous integration is key.

* How many libraries are being used in the project?

* Is the project splitted into different modules?

**Android Resources Usage:**

There is a wide range of devices in the Android world, each one with their own screen size, capabilities, etc. You need to be extra careful and leverage some of the Android tools to provide the best possible experience to your user regardless of their device.

* Are there any missing resources for densities, flavors or build types?

* Are all the requested permissions really needed?

* Is there any permission used maliciously?

* Is there any permission missing?

* Is the target SDK used greater than 23 and the "dangerous permissions" requested using the compatibility permissions system?

* Are the permission requested when they are going to be used?
